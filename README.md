# bone-fracture-detect-resnet-50-resnext-101-fpns
I'm excited to share my latest project, where I developed a bone fracture detection system using ResNet-50 and ResNeXt-101 architectures with Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs).
Image 1: Shoulder fracture detection with confidence scores of 41% and 49%.
Image 2: Finger fracture detection with confidence scores ranging from 25% to 44%.
Image 3: Wrist fracture detection with a confidence score of 34%.
These visualizations demonstrate the model's ability to accurately localize fractures, which could significantly aid in the diagnostic process.
